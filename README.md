# Hi there, I'm Fahim 👋  

🎓 I'm a CSE student who loves diving deep into how technology really works — from the logic inside code to the systems that run it all.  

💻 Currently exploring **C**, **Python**, and soon **C++** for competitive programming. I enjoy breaking problems apart and building things that make sense — clean, efficient, and meaningful.  

🛠️ Outside of pure coding, I’ve explored **WordPress development**, **copywriting**, and a few creative digital projects. I like mixing logic with creativity — because I believe innovation needs both.  

🌍 My long-term goal is to work in **deep tech and system-level development** — creating tools and frameworks that become the foundation for others to build on.
