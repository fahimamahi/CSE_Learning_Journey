# Hi there, This is Fahim! 👋  

🎓 I'm a CSE student who loves diving deep into how technology really works, from the logic inside code to the systems that run it all.  

💻 Currently exploring **C**, **Python**, and soon **C++** for competitive programming. I enjoy breaking problems down and building things that make sense, clean, efficient, and meaningful.  

🛠️ Outside of pure coding, I’ve explored **WordPress development**, **copywriting**, and a few creative digital projects. I like mixing logic with creativity because I believe innovation needs both.  

🌍 My long-term goal is to work in **deep tech and system-level development**, creating tools and frameworks that become the foundation for others to build on.
